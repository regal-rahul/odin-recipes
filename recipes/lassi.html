        Lassi is a yogurt drink especially popular in norther parts of India.
        It’s super simple to make, so simple that you actually need only yogurt
        and water to make it.

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <h4>For Sweet Lassi:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Yogurt: Use plain, whole milk yogurt.</li>
      <li>
        Ice cubes: Serves to properly chill the lassi and slightly dilute the
        yogurt.
      </li>
      <li>Milk: Thins it out while adding richness and balance.</li>
      <li>
        Heavy whipping cream: Amplifies the creamy base (a must for a good
        lassi) and enhances smoothness.
      </li>
      <li>Sugar: You can make it as sweet or unsweet as you’d like.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>INSTRUCTIONS</u></h3>
    <p>
      <b>
        Since we’re using plenty of ice, a powerful blender helps. For regular
        blenders, you may have to partly crush the ice with the milk first.
      </b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add ingredients in a blender and blend until no longer icy. If you’d
        like to keep some of the bits of ice, blend for a shorter time.
      </li>
      <li>It’ll naturally become frothy on top.</li>
      <li>
        Taste and add sugar for sweetness, yogurt for more tart flavor, ice to
        make it cooler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour into two large glasses or 3-4 small. This recipe makes around 4
        cups (32 oz), so 2 large lassis or 4 kid-size, though my kids usually
        demand more than 8 oz.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><u>NOTES</u></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>TIPS FOR THE BEST SWEET LASSI</strong>
      <em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Foamy & frothy: Before blenders were a thing, lassi was poured from
            one jug to another to create the signature froth. Thanks to
            blenders, now you can get the same froth sans arm workout.
          </li>
          <li>
            Creamy & Smooth: My secret ingredient is a touch of whipping cream,
            which made the Lassi rich and silky without being heavy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cold: Temperature is one of the most overlooked aspects of a good
            Lassi, which is why ice is a required ingredient (I’ve even given
            the quantity in grams).
          </li>
        </ul>
