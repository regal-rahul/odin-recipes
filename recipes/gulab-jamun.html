    <h3><u>NOTES</u></h3>
    <p>
      <strong>TIPS: </strong>
      <em>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you fry jamuns on high flame, they will immediately turn brown
            from outside and remain uncooked from inside, so fry them on low to
            medium flame.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don’t add hot deep fried jamun directly into warm sugar syrup.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can also use diluted maple syrup instead of saffron flavored
            sugar syrup for Canadian style gulab jamun.
          </li>
          <li>
            For variation, garnish it with pistachio powder or shredded coconut.
          </li>
        </ul>
